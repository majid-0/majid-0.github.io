I am an Electrical Engineer with a deep passion for understanding the intricate workings of our tech-driven society. My research primarily focuses on RF engineering, with key interests in:

- Satellite Communications
- Antennas and Electromagnetic Propagation
- Applications of Machine Learning in Wireless Communication
- RF Power Amplifier Design & Linearization
- Microwave Engineering in general

I earned my BSc degree with honors from the American University of Sharjah in 2022, and I am currently pursuing my MSc at the same institution, with an anticipated graduation date in December 2024.

Driven by a relentless curiosity, I am deeply committed to lifelong learning. The more I explore and discover, the more I realize the vastness of knowledge yet to be uncovered.
